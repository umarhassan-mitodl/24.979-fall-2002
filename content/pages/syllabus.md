**Course Description**

Syllabus ({{% resource_link 1b687154-efab-3b2d-3c82-db121c75e91e "PDF" %}})

This seminar will investigate the expression of gradability, comparison and degree in natural language. The course will address the following major issues, though we may also include other topics according to the interests and direction of the class:

*   The underlying semantic representation of expressions of degree and the linguistic significance of scalar representations
*   The logical form of comparative constructions, and the implications of comparatives for other aspects of the grammar
*   The semantics of degree and the role of scalar representations in grammatical categories other than gradable adjectives

Requirements
------------

Students enrolled in the course are expected to do the assigned readings and to participate fully in the classroom discussion, and they will also be required to write a research paper for the course. The topic should be selected in consultation with the instructors no later than the tenth week of the course. We will set aside the final week of the course for a research seminar in which students can present their work.
